            Athulya Home Healthcare provides medical equipment and consumables
            for seniors in Chennai. Hospitals have every facility for the
            elderly to support their body when they are sick or in the treatment
            & recovery phase. What if we tell you you can have the exact
            facilities at your home? Surprised? But this is true.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2 text-justify btn-sub-para">
            After a long or short stay in the hospital for treatment, seniors
            might face difficulty to accommodate themselves at home. You might
            be thinking the reason behind this is the absence of medical
            professionals who would have provided 24/7 supervision of the
            elderly. But the main reason for this is that the home won't have
            the medical equipment and consumables available in the hospital. You
            would have noticed the facilities, equipment, and consumables in the
            hospitals. The cot, chairs, beds everything will be different from
            the ones you will be having at your home. This is because the
            facilities at the hospital will focus on providing comfort to the
            patient.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2 text-justify btn-sub-para">
            Seeing the facilities at the hospital and if you are searching for a
            hospital bed for home or a patient bed for home or a wheelchair for
            rent in Chennai then you are on the right page.
